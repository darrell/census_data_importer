Overview
========
This is a set of quick and dirty scripts for loading census ACS data into a postgres database.

I've tested it on ACS2010_5yr data, and ACS2011_5yr data, using ruby 1.9.3.
Ruby 1.8.7 will probably work, but given how painfully slow the CSV module is,
you'll want to take steps to update that to FasterCSV. Other databases may
well work, as long as you specify `:use_copy => false` where appropriate, but I
have not tested it.

The only gems required are 'pg' and 'sequel'.

There is one caveat, you must download the "[Sequence_Number_and_Table_Number_
Lookup.txt](ftp://ftp.census.gov/acs2011_5yr/summaryfile/Sequence_Number_and_T
able_Number_Lookup.txt]" file as well as any census data. This table is used
to generate two tables, which the importer script then uses to create and
import the rest of the tables.

Look at the import_census.rb script to get the workflow.

It is *slow*, and I'm sorry I can't help much with that – blame the ruby CSV parser.

Using imported data
===================

The tables are named after the associated table name as displayed in
[FactFinder](http://factfinder2.census.gov), and the columns are similary
cryptically named. Getting the right table and column can be an excercise in
frustration. However, looking at the `census_column_lookup` table, generated by
`create_lookup_tables()` will get you pointed in the right direction.

In order to get data for a specific  geographic area, you must join through the `geoheader` table.

Example
-------

Let's say we are trying to get the population for men and women for each county in
the state of the California. By looking through `census_column_lookup` or the
ACS website, we find that the table we are after is "B01001": "SEX BY AGE". That gives us (edited down for space):

```sql
SELECT "table_id",
       "column_id",
       "column_title",
       "topic",
       "table_universe",
       "subject_area"
FROM "acs2011_5yr"."census_column_lookup"
WHERE "table_id"='B01001';
```

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th align="center">table_id</th>
    <th align="center">column_id</th>
    <th align="center">column_title</th>

    <td align="left">Female:</td>
    <td align="left">SEX BY AGE</td>
    <td align="left">Total population</td>
    <td align="left">[NULL]</td>

  <tr valign="top">
    <td align="left">B01001</td>
    <td align="left">B010010027</td>
    <td align="left">Under 5 years</td>
    <td align="left">SEX BY AGE</td>
    <td align="left">Total population</td>
    <td align="left">[NULL]</td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td align="left">B01001</td>
    <td align="left">B010010028</td>
    <td align="left">5 to 9 years</td>
    <td align="left">SEX BY AGE</td>
    <td align="left">Total population</td>

Unfortunately, the Census does not see fit to break this down hierarchically,
but you can see that  in some `column_title` columns the entry ends with a ':' – this
tells us that what follows is a subset of a previous column that ended with a
':', but it doesn't (annoyingly) tell you which one, so you'll have to use your
intuition, or look the table up on FactFinder, which displays the headings
appropriately indented.

So, from this we can see that the male population is in column "B010010002"
and the female population in column "B010010026". (If we had wanted the female
population aged 10-14, then we could have chosen "B010010029").

So to get those population columns we could do:

```sql
SELECT "B010010002" AS male_pop,
       "B010010026" AS female_pop
FROM "acs2011_5yr"."B01001" AS pop;
```

However, that does not tell us anything about what geographical area that
number refers to. In order to do that, we need to join to the `geoheader`
table to the data table using the `logrecno` field and on the state
abbreviation (national level data uses the abbreviation 'us').

I personally do a `LEFT JOIN` from the `geoheader` table to the 
desired, which is especially critical if you want to join more than
one data table, just in case there is data missing from the table. For example:

```sql
SELECT "geo"."name",
       "B010010002" AS male_pop,
       "B010010026" AS female_pop
FROM "acs2011_5yr"."geoheader" AS geo
LEFT OUTER JOIN "acs2011_5yr"."B01001" AS pop ON (geo.logrecno=pop.logrecno
                                                  AND geo.stusab=pop.stusab);
```

Finally, if we want to limit the data to just california counties, then we
must add the appropriate `WHERE` clauses:

```sql
SELECT "geo"."name",
       "B010010002" AS male_pop,
       "B010010026" AS female_pop
FROM "acs2011_5yr"."geoheader" AS geo
LEFT OUTER JOIN "acs2011_5yr"."B01001" AS pop ON (geo.logrecno=pop.logrecno
                                                  AND upper(geo.stusab)=upper(pop.stusab))
WHERE geo.stusab='ca'
  AND geo.sumlevel = '50';
```

If you have loaded Census TIGER data and want to join to that, then you must also join on
the `geoid_tiger` column (not the `geoid` column, because that would be too easy).

```sql
SELECT "geo"."name",
       "B010010002" AS male_pop,
       "B010010026" AS female_pop
FROM "acs2011_5yr"."geoheader" AS geo
LEFT OUTER JOIN "acs2011_5yr"."B01001" AS pop ON (geo.logrecno=pop.logrecno
                                                  AND upper(geo.stusab)=upper(pop.stusab))
JOIN "tiger"."county" co ON co.geoid = geo.geoid_tiger
WHERE geo.stusab='ca'
  AND geo.sumlevel = '50';
```
